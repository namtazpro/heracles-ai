# Deploying Heracles

> Feel free to just read this site, but if you want to deploy, the best thing its to [fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo). Once forked, go to your copy.  Click on actions.  If you are asked click on “I Understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them”. You may need to correct a few things (such as the badges above). 

Deploying Heracles is easy.  Follow these simple steps:

1. Greate a service account with contributor rights to your subscription
1. Update GitHub secrets in your forked repo
1. Execute the [Deploy Heracles Workflow] ()
